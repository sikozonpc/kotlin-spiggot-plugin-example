Sample plugin built with Kotlin, don't forget to change the **Kotlin**, **Java** and **SpiggotAPI** versions in the `pom.xml` according to the ones you're using.
Also don't forget to change the kotlin version on the `plugin.yml` as well. 

### Caveat
To build the plugin into a Jar from IntelIJ don't forget to tick the "Include in project build" checkbox in the 
Project Structure menu when adding an artifact.
